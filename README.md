# rock-paper-scissors

Simple rock, paper, scissors game. Learned how to apply everything I learned so far in javascript. Code/Algorithm used might be messy(could've done better) in the game function since I used RegEx which I'm not that much familiar as of now. _07/22 Please redo in the future if that is the case_

_08/02/22_ Added ui and changed some of the structure and algorithms used on some parts of the code. I was able to apply things that I learned in javascript and css. Being able to finally understand DOM was really a big help in this project. Might add some more features like animations, icons and more functionality in the future.
