# rock-paper-scissors

Simple rock, paper, scissors game. Learned how to apply everything I learned so far in javascript. Code/Algorithm used might be messy(could've done better) in the game function since I used RegEx which I'm not that much familiar as of now. _07/22 Please redo in the future if that is the case_
